# ChangeKit
### Browser Edition

Easily create simple changelogs for your projects. Download ChangeKit, extract the .ZIP, and bookmark `/changekit/index.html` in your browser of choice. 
Use ChangeKit by adding categories with Headers and descriptive bullet points.

When you're done, change the color of the header lines to match your website's theme, and compile your code. Copy the code (appears at the bottom of the page). 
This code can be pasted into any html-capable website, and most markdown sites. For example, in a GitHub Page.

I recommend downloading the latest version (see [Releases](https://github.com/TheWarHawk2005/changekit/releases)).
